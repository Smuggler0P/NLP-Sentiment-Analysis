This repository hosts a collection of tools and models for sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the emotional tone behind a piece of text, whether it's positive, negative, or neutral. 

**Key Features**:
1. **Preprocessing Utilities**: Includes scripts and functions for text cleaning, tokenization, and normalization, crucial steps before performing sentiment analysis.
2. **Lexicon-based Analysis**: Implementation of lexicon-based sentiment analysis techniques such as Vader and TextBlob.
3. **Machine Learning Models**: Various machine learning models (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, LSTM) for sentiment classification trained on different datasets.
4. **Deep Learning Architectures**: State-of-the-art deep learning architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sentiment analysis.
5. **Evaluation Metrics**: Functions to evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Interactive Web Interface**: Integration with Flask or Streamlit to create a user-friendly web application for real-time sentiment analysis.

**Usage**:
- Researchers and practitioners can use this repository as a starting point for sentiment analysis projects, leveraging the provided utilities and models.
- Developers can fork this repository to extend its functionality or integrate it into their applications.
- Educational institutions can use it as a teaching resource for NLP and sentiment analysis courses.
